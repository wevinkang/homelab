After building my own PC, I thought to move my home lab from my Macbook Pro over to my new desktop.

The major issue in doing this was trying to solve the file format compatibility issues between the two. 
- This ended up being resolved with the software MacDrive that allows Windows to read Apple file systems
- They offer a free trial so the solution didn't cost a penny and moving the VMs from my Macbook could simply be done with my external hard drive

However, after procrastinating touching my home lab due to the forementioned issue, it turns out I forgot my password to my Windows victim VM.
I tried looking for solutions with no hope and almost thought to just restart the installation of the Windows VM all over again, but wanted to see if I could troubleshoot this problem another way.
Eventually I found a subreddit to a link that was able to help reset the Windows password with a Boot CD (https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=171&q=hard+drive+file+types&cvid=b038a335d2da44acba9780efa8aea4d4&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDYwMjdqMGoxqAIAsAIA&FORM=ANNTA1&PC=U531)
