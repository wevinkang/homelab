Create a user with sudo priv instead of using root. However, I am securing a raspberry pi server and root login is default disabled and user with sudo priv was already configured during OS installation.

Securing SSH
- Using publickey authentication and then requiring all password authentications to use 2FA/MFA.
- Configuring sshd_config settings securely

TODO
- Set up ufw firewall and rules
- Setup network security monitoring
