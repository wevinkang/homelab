# Booting Tails with a USB Stick

## Requirements
1. A blank USB stick - 8GB minimum
2. A computer to install Tails onto the USB

## Installation
1. Select the OS you're using to install Tails from https://tails.net/install/index.en.html and follow the steps
Note: I ran into a module not found error when trying to flash the the USB stick and this was simply resolved by running balenaEtcher as administrator (Windows).
