# Homelab Repository

Welcome to my Homelab.

## Introduction

This repository is a documentation of my journey in learning and experimenting with different technologies, tools, and practices in the realm of home networking, computing, and security.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of my progress, serve as a reference for future use, and share my experiences with anyone who might find them useful. 

## What's Inside

In this repository, you'll find notes, configuration files, scripts, and other resources related to my homelab setup. These materials cover a wide range of topics, from network configuration and server setup, software installation and troubleshooting, and security best practices.

## Learning Process

Learning is a continuous process. As I continue to explore and learn new things, I will update this repository accordingly. Each update will reflect my growing knowledge and skills in managing and maintaining a homelab.

## Contribution

While this repository primarily serves as a personal learning journal, contributions and suggestions are always welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have something to add or correct.
